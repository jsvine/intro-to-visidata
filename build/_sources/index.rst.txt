An Introduction to VisiData
===========================

`VisiData <http://visidata.org/>`_ is a free, open-source tool that lets you **quickly open, explore, summarize, and analyze** datasets in your computer's terminal. VisiData works with CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, SQL databases, and `many other data sources <basics/opening-files/#compatible-filetypes>`_. The interface looks like this:

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../terminal/output/faa-operator-frequency.output.html

Very quickly, VisiData has become the tool I reach for first when I encounter a new dataset. I think you might enjoy it, too.
