====================
Creating New Columns
====================

In any VisiData sheet, you can create a blank column by typing :kbd:`za`. But VisiData also provides many powerful ways to create new, dyanamic columns. These are four of the most useful ways:

- Increments
- Expressions (like functions in Excel, etc.)
- Splits (breaking up one text column into several)
- Captures (extracting one chunk of a text column)

How to create an incremented column
-----------------------------------

You can add an incremented column with **sequential values** (akin to row numbers) by pressing :kbd:`i`. Once you do that, VisiData will create this new column directly to the right of your current column:

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../../terminal/output/newcols-00a-increment-basic.output.html

By default, VisiData will name the column ``A`` (or ``B`` if VisiData has already created an ``A`` column this session, and so on).

.. note::

    You can customize the "step" between values; to do that, type :kbd:`zi`, and specify a number at the prompt. (Specifying ``3``, for instance, would create the sequence ``1, 4, 7, ...``.)

How to create an expression column
----------------------------------

Expression columns **evaluate** a given Python expression for every row in your dataset.

These expressions can reference any column in your dataset (so long as the column name contains only letters, underscores, and numbers, and doesn't start with a number).

.. note::

   If you're unfamiliar with Python, no worries. You can find an overview of simple and handy expressions `here <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html>`_.

You can create an expression column by pressing :kbd:`=`. Once you do so, you'll see a prompt at the bottom of the screen. Then, type your desired expression and press :kbd:`Enter`.

Perhaps the simplest expression column would be ``=1``; for every row, the column's value would be ``1``. Let's see how that looks:

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../../terminal/output/newcols-00-simple.output.html

.. note::

   By default, the name of your new columns will be the expression you entered. As always, you can edit the column name by pressing :kbd:`^` and typing the new name.

   Also by default, the column will appear directly to the right of the column that was active when you pressed :kbd:`=`. As always, you can move the column left or right using :kbd:`Shift-H` and :kbd:`Shift-L`.

Now, let's try creating a column *based on another column*. Let's say we want to identify wildlife strikes that were reported to have occurred at least 100 feet above ground. We could do the following:

- Navigate to the ``HEIGHT`` column
- Press :kbd:`#` to tell VisiData the column's values should be interpreted as integers
- Press :kbd:`=` to bring up the "new column expr=" prompt
- In the prompt, type ``HEIGHT >= 100``
- Press :kbd:`Enter`

You should see something like the following:

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../../terminal/output/newcols-01-operator.output.html


How to create new columns by splitting another one
--------------------------------------------------

You can split the text in any column in VisiData into two or more columns, based on a pattern (i.e., a "regular expression" a.k.a. "regex") that you provide. 

To split a column, navigate to that column, and press :kbd:`:`. At the bottom of the screen, VisiData you'll see a ``split regex:`` prompt. Enter your desired splitting pattern, and press :kbd:`Enter`.

For a simple example, let's say we want to split the ``INCIDENT_DATE`` column into the date and time. Because the date and time are separated by a space, we can do this:

- Navigate to the ``INCIDENT_DATE`` column
- Press :kbd:`:`
- At the prompt, press :kbd:`Space` (since we want to split on the column's whitespace), and then hit :kbd:`Enter`

Once you do that, you should see something like this:

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../../terminal/output/newcols-02-split.output.html

Each value in the new column is a list of the pieces that resulted from the split. But you probably want them each piece in its own column. To do that press :kbd:`(`, which is the "expand column" command. Now you should see something like this:

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../../terminal/output/newcols-02a-split-expanded.output.html



How to create a new column by "capturing" it from another column
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   This approach requires a bit more knowlege of "regular expressions". If you're unfamiliar with regular expressions and don't want to learn them right now, feel free to skip to the next chapter.

Just like you can split a column by using :kbd:`:`, you can extract part of a column into a new column by using :kbd:`;`.

For instance, if you want to extract the first string of numbers from each aircraft type, (e.g., ``28`` from ``PA-28``, ``46`` from ``PA-46 MALIBU``, and ``717`` from ``B-717-200``). To do that, take the following steps:

- Navigate to the ``ATYPE`` column
- Press :kbd:`;`
- At the prompt, type ``(\d+)`` (with one set of parentheses for each capture group), and then hit :kbd:`Enter`
- Press :kbd:`(` to expand the new column's lists

Once you do that, you should see something like this:

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../../terminal/output/newcols-03-capture.output.html
